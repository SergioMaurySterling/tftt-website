        <p>
          FILM<span>COIN</span> aims to decentralize the film and television content production industries; we propose to create an ecosystem for the existing and to be developed film and television production markets with transparent rewards catered to the participantsâ€™ role and contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants in FILM<span>COIN</span> will have the option to experience a new ecosystem by taking upon the role of a creator, curator, translator, reviewer, viewer and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          FILM<span>COIN</span> aims to tokenise both new and previously released film and television productions.
        </p>
        <p>
          FILM<span>COIN</span> will run blockchain-based online file sharing programs specifically aimed to discover potential new Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, Production Crew, Musicians and talented new creators.
        </p>
        <p>
          FILM<span>COIN</span> will potentially reward creators immediately according to the blockchain based smart contract once the creator uploads and users purchase their content. Creators will be provided with insights from their own followers and viewer data, such as gender, age, and traffic source. The insight will help creators to develop and cater content in order to satisfy their own targeted audience.
