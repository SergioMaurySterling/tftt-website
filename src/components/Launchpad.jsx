        FILMCOIN Token IDO Launchpad Summary:
        Our goal is to raise a maximum of USD $24 million and a minimum
        of USD $1.5 million. Some of the financial assumptions may
        change with ETH / USD exchange rates and volatility,
        but the following numbers are best effort projected
        estimates as of February 28, 2022.

        <span>Projected Assumption â€“ 1 ETH = USD $3000.00</span>
